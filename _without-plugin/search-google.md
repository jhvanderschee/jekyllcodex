title: Search with Google
---

### Introduction

Modern websites have a search bar, searching within the site for specific content. These search boxes often search the database in real-time. That is not possible within a static website. Therefore another solution must be found.

### How it works

This search relies on the index from Google. It queries the Google Search engine directly. Results will be shown within the Google interface (on a new page), but will be limited to the site you specified. Click the 'read more' link for a demo.

```
{% raw %}<form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search" target="_blank"><input type="hidden" name="sitesearch" value="yourdomain.com" /><input type="text" name="q" maxlength="255" value="" placeholder="Search via Google" /></form>{% endraw %}
```

{% include search-google.html %}
