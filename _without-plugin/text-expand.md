title: Text expand
---

### Introduction

Sometimes when you want to create a 'read more' link, it is overkill to create a whole new page. In that case a text expand functionality, using javascript is very useful. On this website it is used for clarity and brevity.

### How it works

The script looks for an `[expand]` tag on a single line and then looks for the `[/expand]` tag (again on a single line, thus being the only content of its paragraph). When it finds these it will add some classes and hide everything in between. It will show a 'read more &rarr;' link, indicating the text can be expanded.

[expand]

```
{% include text-expand.html %}
```

[/expand]

### Installation

Step 1. Download the file [text-expand.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhvanderschee/jekyllcodex/gh-pages/_includes/text-expand.html)
<br />Step 2. Save the file in the '_includes' directory of your project
<br />Step 3. Make sure the bottom of your layout document looks like this:

```
{% raw %}...
<script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
{% include text-expand.html %}
</body>
</html>{% endraw %}
```
