I"¶<p>This site exists now for almost two years. It has been a place to collect scripts I have created during the production of over 70 commercial Jekyll websites (I create about 30 commercial Jekyll website per year). It was time to reorder my scripts, so I have rewritten their descriptions to fit the theme â€˜Jekyll without pluginsâ€™.</p>

<p>For easy reuse, I adjusted the scripts so that they work on any website without adjustments (assuming you have a â€˜site.urlâ€™, â€˜site.titleâ€™ and â€˜site.descriptionâ€™ variable in your â€˜_config.ymlâ€™ file). I made downloadable includes of each one of them, including an instruction on how to â€˜installâ€™ them. Note that all scripts that you find on this website are also implemented on this website itself. This makes this site a living example for its own scripts.</p>

<p>I consider the site to be a success when I succesfully use it myself as a library. Please feel free to do the same.</p>
