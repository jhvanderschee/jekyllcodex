title: Getting started with Jekyll
---

I have written a three step&nbsp;[Getting Started manual for Jekyll](http://jekyllcodex.org/getting-started/). The manual can be followed by anyone (no command line needed). Everything you need to do, can be done in a browser and a text editor.

What is Jekyll? Jekyll is the most popular static site generator available. A lot of big companies, like Google and Netflix use Jekyll for their website development. The Obama campaign (fundraising) website was&nbsp;[built](http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/) with Jekyll.

Why should you use Jekyll/a static site generator? Static sites are quick to develop, simple to adjust, hosting is cheaper and they can be easily optimized for SEO and speed. As a bonus, static websites are extremely stable and they can handle a huge amount of visitors.

So do you want a next-generation website? Follow the&nbsp;[Geting Started manual for Jekyll](http://jekyllcodex.org/getting-started/)! Your first Jekyll site is only minutes away!
